#Java Barbell
A digitization of the strength training plans presented in *Tactical Barbell* by
K. Black. The plans are designed for personnel in tactical professions such as
military/law enforcement, firefighters, or other athletes looking to maximize
strength with minimal inputs.

#Important
This program is designed to be used in tandem with the information in *Tactical
Barbell* and will not make sense without it. Information on the recommended
exercises, progression, and plans are all found within the book but NOT within
this program.

#What it Does
Currently, the program allows users to create new plans in either the Operator
or Fighter template, inputting the names and one-rep max's for the exercises they
desire, and print out a 6 week overview of the plan they've created.

More to come soon.

#The Plans
Operator - 3 days a week, 3 exercises a session
Fighter - 2 days a week, 3 exercises a session
Zulu - 4 days a week, A/B split, 2 exercises a session

For more details on the plans and how to successfully implement them, please visit
the Amazon link at the top of this README and purchase the book.
